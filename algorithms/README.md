1. Write an algorithm that reads 3 values a, b, c. Calculate and write the weighted average with weights = 5 for numbers above 6 and weight = 2.5 for numbers below 6.

2. Write an algorithm that reads a set of 4 values i, a, b, c, where i is a positive integer and a, b, c are any real values. Write them. Then:
   - If i=1, write the 3 values a, b, c in ascending order.
   - If i=2, write the 3 values a, b, c in descending order.
   - If i=3, write the 3 values such that the largest value among a, b, c is placed between the other two.

3. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user. Note: The factorial of 0 is 1.

4. Write a program that reads a numeric value. The program should be able to sum all numbers preceding the given value.
   - For example, if the value is 3, calculate 0+1+2 = 3. If the value is 5, calculate 0+1+2+3+4 = 10.

5. Given a natural number in binary base, convert it to decimal base.
   - Example: Given 10010, the output should be 18, because 1×2^4 + 0×2^3 + 0×2^2 + 1×2^1 + 0×2^0 = 18.

6. Given a natural number in decimal base, convert it to binary base.
   - Example: Given 18, the output should be 10010.

7. A positive integer n is called perfect if it equals the sum of its positive divisors excluding n itself.
   - Example: 6 is perfect because 1+2+3 = 6.
   - Given a positive integer n, check if n is perfect.

8. Calculate the sum of the following series:
   - a) S = 1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + ............+ 1/99
   - b) S = 1 – 1/3 + 1/5 – 1/7 + .............for the first 20 terms

9. Write an algorithm for a program that reads a set of 50 records, each containing the name, height, and gender of a person. Calculate and print:
   - a) The tallest and shortest height in the group
   - b) The average height of the women
   - c) The average height of the group

10. Given n and a sequence of n integers, determine the length of the longest increasing segment.
    - Examples:
      - In the sequence 5, 10, 3, 2, 4, 7, 9, 8, 5, the length of the longest increasing segment is 4.
      - In the sequence 10, 8, 7, 5, 2, the length of the longest increasing segment is 1.

11. A natural number n is called a palindrome if:
    - The 1st digit of n is equal to its last digit,
    - The 2nd digit of n is equal to the second-to-last digit,
    - And so on.
    - Examples:
      - 567765 and 32423 are palindromes.
      - 567675 is not a palindrome.
    - Given a natural number n > 10, check if n is a palindrome.
    - Palindromes can also be identified in strings.
      - Examples:
        - REVIVER
        - ANA
        - ASA
        - OSSO
        - RADAR

12. Assuming that the population of country “A” is about 90,000,000 inhabitants, with an annual growth rate of 3%, and the population of country “B” is approximately 200,000,000 inhabitants with an annual growth rate of 1.5%, write an algorithm to calculate and print the number of years required for country “A” to surpass or equal the population of country “B,” maintaining these growth rates.

13. A certain radioactive material loses half of its mass every 50 seconds. Given the initial mass in grams, create an algorithm to determine the time required for the mass to drop below 0.5 grams. Write the initial mass, the final mass, and the time calculated in hours, minutes, and seconds.

14. The Fibonacci series starts with the first two terms being 0 and 1. From these, the subsequent terms are constructed using the rule: t_n = t_(n-1) + t_(n-2).
    - Given n terms, display the terms of the sequence.
